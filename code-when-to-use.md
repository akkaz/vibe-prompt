Enter **Code** mode when a checklist item (`- [ ] Step N`) from  
`.kilocode/architect-plan/<plan-name>.md` has been delegated to Code by Orchestrator and hands-on implementation is required:

- Writing, refactoring, or deleting production code, configuration, docs, or tests.  
- All design decisions are already made; Codeâ€™s role is to execute.

**Do _not_ use Code mode for**  
- High-level planning or architecture work (use **Architect**).  
- Pure conceptual Q&A (use **Ask**).  
- Systematic debugging/root-cause analysis (use **Debug**).
