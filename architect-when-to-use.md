### Architect — When to Use
Activate **Architect** when the user’s request:

- **Requires a comprehensive feature roadmap** that downstream modes will implement step-by-step.  
- **Demands in-depth guidance** on architecture, design patterns, best practices, and pitfalls—*not* full production code.  
- **Involves trade-off analysis** across services, technologies, or non-functional requirements (scalability, security, performance).

**Skip Architect for**  
- Minor bug fixes or single-file tweaks.  
- Pure conceptual Q&A (use **Ask**).  
- Implementation work once a plan exists (use **Code** or **Debug**).
